**Accessible by nature** is a foundational company value for our products and brand. We understand that there are a wide range of human experiences and abilities that require a unique experience for each use-case.

At Pluralsight, we have an a11y team (of people who actually require a11y software) that is devoted to ensuring everything we do, from the colors we present to our engineering code bases, is being executed at the highest level to ensure we are providing enhanced, usable experiences for _all_ people.

## Colors

The themes we provide in our UI Kit meet passing constrast standards and are also **colorblind friendly by default** (we test with actual colorblind teammates and not using software that mimics what it thinks people see - typically wrong in most cases).

## Software

Our a11y team validates all of our APIs to ensure we are passing WCAG compliance standards with each feature.
