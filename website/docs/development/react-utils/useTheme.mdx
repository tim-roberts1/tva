A custom hook for managing [Pando themes](../tokens/colors.mdx#themes).

## Import

```javascript
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'
```

## Basic Usage

To use `useTheme` you can either call it with no options or pass in a default theme to automatically set.

If no theme is originally set/cached, the `dark` theme will be used as the default.

```typescript
type Themes = 'light' | 'dark'

useTheme(preferredTheme?: Themes)
```

:::tip Automatic Theme Caching

This hook automatically caches the theme to the `localStorage` Object so that your users will have it saved for as long as they keep the cache alive. :tada:

:::

## Return Value

The `useTheme` hook returns a memoized Object with properties of `theme`, `value`, and an `toggleTheme` memoized callback.

```jsx title="useTheme return value"
{
  toggleTheme: memoized Callback Function,
  theme: string,
}
```

## Example usage in Component

Here is an example of how you might use `useTheme` to manage theme toggling in an
App parent component.

```jsx showLineNumbers {2}
function App() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>This is an example with Theme toggling!</p>
        <button {...getButtonProps().button} onClick={toggleTheme}>
          Toggle Theme
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::info

The `useTheme` hook is currently only compatible for client-side apps. However,
there is currently an [open issue](https://github.com/pluralsight/pando/issues/1065) to handle this fix in a future release.
