# Vision

Our vision is to provide an elegant framework-agnostic implementation of the Pluralsight Design guidelines that can be customized to fully match your brand.

The Pluralsight Design guidelines are an incredible starting point, but they do not provide guidance on all aspects or needs of an application. In addition to the guidelines-specific implementation, we want Pluralsight Design to become whatever is generally useful for application development, all in the spirit of the Pluralsight Design guidelines.

Therefore, Pluralsight Design will be not only be an implementation of the Pluralsight Design guidelines, but a general use UI library that is needed by many. This generalized use doesn't imply any other design methodology.

We will focus on providing all the low-level tools needed to build a rich user-interface with any UI framework or library (React, MUI, Svelte, etc.). Once we implement the Pluralsight Design guidelines, you should be able to take advantage of it for your own business with any style customization needed. We want to see companies succeeding using Pluralsight Design in a way that matches their brand, close to the Pluralsight philosophy or not. We don't want them to feel that their UI simply looks like another Pluralsight product.

From a developer's point of view, we want Pluralsight Design to:

- Deliver on fully composable "headless" helpers.
- Be themable / customizable.
- Be cross-browser compatible and accessible.
- Promote developer joy, a sense of community, and an environment where new and experienced developers can learn from each other.
