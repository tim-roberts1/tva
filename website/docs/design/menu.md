## Usage

### Types

- **Default:** Used for single action navigation or applying actions to a page.
- **Select:** Used for multi-select option menus.

### Best practices

- When listing site sections, use leading icons for important and top-level menu items to help with scannability.
  - Leading icons may not be necessary in all contexts. Do not repeat icons for nested menus.
- Use menu-extras such as headings and dividers to separate logical chunks of menu-items to enhance legibility and compartmentalization for the user. Consider using dividers when utilizing sublabels.

### Dos and Don'ts

- Don't truncate or wrap menu labels.

## Content Guidance

### Microcopy

- Use Title case for navigational menu items.
- Use sentence case for all other uses.
- Keep menu labels below 20 characters.
